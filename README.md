# Preceptron-Implementation
## Here I'm gonna share my different approaches in implementing a perceptron.

There is a perceptron class which I can use it whenever I want with any training data I require...
Here I had a dataset of 200 points of x and y and what I did was training this dataset by a perceptron learning algorithm and see the result.
Actually I had to have a big number of epochs becaue the data was really limited .
At the end I have visualized my results by Matplotlib of python.
I have attached the results in my files...
Now I'm trying to make this better actually
